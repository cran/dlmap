* dlmap.asreml and dlmap.lme functions combined as a parameter (algorithm) in dl  map function

* fixed bug in profileplot function

* high-dimensional transform implemented for association mapping; will be 
  performed if the number of markers on all chromosomes > number of individuals.  Internal improvement to computational efficiency.
